# Python_MachineLearning
My project for dlithe internship

This project is my take on data visualization using machine learning with python to analyse the pandemic outbreak of Covid-19.

The datasets I used are from kaggle. I have worked on multiple datasets as one dataset doesn't provide every detail needed for analysis.

Reference: This was done as a part of my virtual internship with Dlithe (www.dlithe.com).
